## Overview

The task is to analyze a large body of data and produce a report of the
findings.  This program summarizes national employment data collected by the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2020.  The report consists of two sections,
a summary across all industries and a summary across the software publishing
industry.

## Objectives

-   Learn how to process a large body of data
-   Using Python's built-in string operations
-   Research programming documentation
-   Reading, understanding, and following instructions
-   Using advanced data structures (list, dictionary, set)
-   Apply problem solving strategies
    -   Divide the problem
    -   Reduce the problem
    -   Don't get frustrated
-   Exercise debugging techniques
    -   Direct debugging with the IDE
    -   Indirect debugging
    -   Wolf-Fence debugging


## Expected Behavior

Each subfolder of [data/](data) contains a file named `output.txt`.
The program's output for that data set should match that file exactly.
